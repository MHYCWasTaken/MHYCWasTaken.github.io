Mhyc, a student very interested in science and technology, know both about software and hardware, looking forward to be a full stack engineer and would like to cut videos and upload it to Bilibili.

(although I can't understand the circuit diagram, the algorithm is in a mess and the video edited by me is so bad that I don't want to watch it again)


This website is a personal blog of mhyc133 based on Jekyll, MrGreen Theme and SakuraFrp, bing wallpaper suppored by [https://bing.img.run](https://bing.img.run)
