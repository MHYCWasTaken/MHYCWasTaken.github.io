## Lets do some math

We got 3 integers : a, b, and d
d is the greatest common divisor of a and b

(a/d)/(b/d) is not a intenger
and either do (b/d)/(a/d)

for example, 252(21 * 12) and 105(21 * 15)
x=a/d
y=b/d
f(x,y)=1

According to `Bézout's lemma`, for any integers a, b, m  
and unknown number x and y, the equation

```
ax + by = m
```

has and only has one solution when m is n times of d  
(d is greatest common divisor of a and b)

First, lets make a function : f(a, b) = g  
g is the greatest common divisor of a and b  
and a > b

And we've got : `f(a, b) = f(b, a % b)`
Specially : `f(a, 0) = a`

But why?

Lets draw a table:

```
a 
b
```
